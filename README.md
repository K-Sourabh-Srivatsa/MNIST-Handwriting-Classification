# MNIST-Handwriting-Classification

This Python code implements a deep learning model for handwritten digit recognition using the classic MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, offering a streamlined and efficient approach to training a neural network for this task.

**MNIST Dataset**

The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark for image classification, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is 28x28 pixels, providing a valuable resource for training and evaluating machine learning models in computer vision tasks.
